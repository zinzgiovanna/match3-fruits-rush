    <h2>Fruits Rush. Match 3 Game: About Game</h2>
    <p>Play a classic match-three puzzle game on a 9x9 grid with three unique shapes. The
        field starts filled randomly to prevent immediate matches. Swap adjacent pieces strategically to form rows of
        three or more matching shapes.</p>
    <p>When a row is created, it disappears, and upper chips fill the empty spaces. Earn points for each cleared row: 10
        for watermelon, 20 for strawberry, and 30 for lemon. If multiple rows are formed, the process repeats. If no
        immediate matches are possible, the chips' positions change randomly while maintaining the quantity of each
        shape.</p>
    <p>Challenge your skills and enjoy the dynamic gameplay of this captivating match-three experience!</p>
